### Dotfiles

I'm doing one separate branch for each window manager just because it keeps things more organized for me and each WM may have their own polybar configuration. But most of the things (TMUX, NVIM, Alacritty, ZSH...) share the same configuration through the different branches.

## branch: bspwm_A 

"Totally" stable and functional to be used. Use this branch if you are using a one-monitor setup (doesn't matter if it's a laptop monitor or an external monitor).

## branch: awesomewm 

Not stable and totally functional because I'm using Polybar and it isn't very easy to integrate both together.
